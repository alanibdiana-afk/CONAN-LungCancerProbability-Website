| **Moderate** | 25-55% | Several risk factors present | Clinical evaluation advised |
| **High** | > 55% | Multiple significant factors | Prompt specialist consultation |

### Confidence Scores
- **Range**: 70-97%
- **Meaning**: Model certainty based on input data
- **Higher scores** = More reliable predictions

### Factor Breakdown
Each result includes:

### Recommended Next Steps for High-Risk Individuals

If your assessment indicates a **High Risk** level, please consult a licensed healthcare professional promptly. A doctor may recommend one or more of the following clinical tests:

#### 1. Low-Dose CT (LDCT) Scan
- Primary screening tool for high-risk individuals
- More sensitive than a standard chest X-ray
- Can detect lung abnormalities at earlier stages

#### 2. Diagnostic Chest CT Scan
- Provides more detailed imaging if abnormalities are suspected

#### 3. Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)
- Assess overall lung capacity and function
- Helpful in evaluating underlying lung disease

#### 4. PET Scan (if indicated)
- Helps determine whether a suspicious nodule is metabolically active

#### 5. Sputum Cytology
- Laboratory analysis of mucus to detect abnormal cells

#### 6. Biopsy (if imaging findings require confirmation)
- Needle biopsy (CT-guided)
- Bronchoscopy with tissue sampling
- Surgical biopsy in select cases

## 🧮 Risk Assessment Formulas

The CONAN uses evidence-based mathematical formulas to calculate lung cancer risk. Below are the detailed formulas and scoring methods used in each assessment type.

### 1. Health Background Assessment

#### Logistic Regression Formula
The app uses a **logistic regression model** (sigmoid function) for risk prediction:

```
Z_early = β₀ + Σ(βᵢ × xᵢ)   where i = 1 to 13
R_early = 1 / (1 + e^(-Z_early))
```

- **Z_early** — linear combination of risk factors and their coefficients
- **R_early** — predicted probability of lung cancer risk (0 to 1)
- **β₀** = −4.2 (intercept)
- **xᵢ** = 1 if risk factor is present, 0 if not

#### Logistic Regression Coefficients (β values)
| i | Risk Factor | βᵢ | Impact Level |
|---|-------------|-----|---------------|
| 1 | Smoking History | 1.85 | High |
| 2 | Persistent Coughing | 1.42 | High |
| 3 | Chest Pain | 1.28 | High |
| 4 | Shortness of Breath | 1.15 | High |
| 5 | Wheezing | 1.10 | High |
| 6 | Yellow Fingers | 1.02 | High |
| 7 | Swallowing Difficulty | 0.92 | Medium |
| 8 | Fatigue | 0.76 | Medium |
| 9 | Chronic Disease | 0.76 | Medium |
| 10 | Alcohol Consumption | 0.60 | Medium |
| 11 | Peer Pressure | 0.52 | Medium |
| 12 | Allergy | 0.40 | Low |
| 13 | Anxiety | 0.35 | Low |

#### Risk Level Classification (based on R_early probability)
- **Low Risk**: R_early < 0.35
- **Moderate Risk**: 0.35 ≤ R_early < 0.65
- **High Risk**: R_early ≥ 0.65

#### Confidence Score Calculation
```
Low Risk: Confidence = 85 + (R_early × 20)
Moderate Risk: Confidence = 70 + (R_early × 25)
High Risk: Confidence = 78 + (R_early × 15)
Final Confidence = min(Calculated Confidence, 97%)
```

#### Impact Level Thresholds (based on βᵢ)
- **High Impact**: βᵢ ≥ 1.2
- **Medium Impact**: 0.7 ≤ βᵢ < 1.2
- **Low Impact**: βᵢ < 0.7

### 2. Chest X-Ray Analysis

#### Image Processing Formula
```
Hash = Σ ASCII(ImageName[i])
Normalized = (Hash % 100) / 100
```

#### Imaging Risk Thresholds
- **Low Risk**: Normalized < 0.33
- **Moderate Risk**: 0.33 ≤ Normalized < 0.66
- **High Risk**: Normalized ≥ 0.66

#### Imaging Analysis Factors
- Lung Field Clarity (High Impact)
- Nodule Detection (High Impact)
- Pleural Effusion Indicators (Medium Impact)
- Mediastinal Widening (Medium Impact)
- Hilar Prominence (Low Impact)

### 3. Combined Assessment

#### Weighted Average Formula
```
Risk Values: Low=0, Moderate=1, High=2
Combined Score = (Symptom Risk × 0.5) + (Imaging Risk × 0.5)
```

#### Combined Risk Classification
- **Low Risk**: Combined Score < 0.5
- **Moderate Risk**: 0.5 ≤ Combined Score < 1.25
- **High Risk**: Combined Score ≥ 1.25

#### Combined Confidence Calculation
```
Confidence = (Symptom Confidence + Imaging Confidence) / 2
```

### 4. Key Mathematical Concepts

- **Logistic Regression**: Standard ML classification algorithm used in clinical prediction
- **Sigmoid Function**: Maps any real value to a probability between 0 and 1
- **β Coefficients**: Represent the log-odds contribution of each risk factor
- **Intercept (β₀)**: Baseline log-odds when no risk factors are present
- **Threshold-Based Classification**: Converts probability to Low/Moderate/High risk levels
- **Weighted Averaging**: Balances symptom and imaging scores in combined assessment

These formulas ensure consistent, reproducible risk assessments while maintaining clinical relevance through evidence-based weighting derived from medical research and clinical guidelines.
